Incomplete beta integral

Returns incomplete beta integral of the arguments, evaluated
from zero to x.  The function is defined as

                 x
    -            -
   | (a+b)      | |  a-1     b-1
 -----------    |   t   (1-t)   dt.
  -     -     | |
 | (a) | (b)   -
                0

The domain of definition is 0 <= x <= 1.  In this
implementation a and b are restricted to positive values.
The integral from x to 1 may be obtained by the symmetry
relation

   1 - incbet( a, b, x )  =  incbet( b, a, 1-x ).

The integral is evaluated by a continued fraction expansion
or, when b*x is small, by a power series.

ACCURACY:

Tested at uniformly distributed random points (a,b,x) with a and b
in "domain" and x between 0 and 1.

Inverse of imcomplete beta integral

Given y, the function finds x such that

 incbet( a, b, x ) = y .

The routine performs interval halving or Newton iterations to find the
root of incbet(a,b,x) - y = 0.
