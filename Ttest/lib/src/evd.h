Output parameters:
    D       -   array of the eigenvalues found.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..I2-I1].
    Z       -   if ZNeeded is equal to:
                 * 0, doesn't contain any information;
                 * 1, contains the product of a given NxN matrix Z (from the left) and
                   Nx(I2-I1) matrix of the eigenvectors found (from the right).
                   Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..I2-I1].
                 * 2, contains the matrix of the eigenvalues found.
                   Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..I2-I1].


Result:

    True, if successful. In that case, D contains the eigenvalues,
    Z contains the eigenvectors (if needed).
    It should be noted that the subroutine changes the size of arrays D and Z.

    False, if the bisection method subroutine wasn't able to find the eigenvalues
    in the given interval or if the inverse iteration subroutine wasn't able
    to find all the corresponding eigenvectors. In that case, the eigenvalues
    and eigenvectors are not returned.

Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a general matrix

The algorithm finds eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a general matrix by
using the QR algorithm with multiple shifts. The algorithm can find
eigenvalues and both left and right eigenvectors.

The right eigenvector is a vector x such that A*x = w*x, and the left
eigenvector is a vector y such that y'*A = w*y' (here y' implies a complex
conjugate transposition of vector y).

Input parameters:
    A       -   matrix. Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    VNeeded -   flag controlling whether eigenvectors are needed or not.
                If VNeeded is equal to:
                 * 0, eigenvectors are not returned;
                 * 1, right eigenvectors are returned;
                 * 2, left eigenvectors are returned;
                 * 3, both left and right eigenvectors are returned.

Output parameters:
    WR      -   real parts of eigenvalues.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    WR      -   imaginary parts of eigenvalues.
                Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
    VL, VR  -   arrays of left and right eigenvectors (if they are needed).
                If WI[i]=0, the respective eigenvalue is a real number,
                and it corresponds to the column number I of matrices VL/VR.
                If WI[i]>0, we have a pair of complex conjugate numbers with
                positive and negative imaginary parts:
                    the first eigenvalue WR[i] + sqrt(-1)*WI[i];
                    the second eigenvalue WR[i+1] + sqrt(-1)*WI[i+1];
                    WI[i]>0
                    WI[i+1] = -WI[i] < 0
                In that case, the eigenvector  corresponding to the first
                eigenvalue is located in i and i+1 columns of matrices
                VL/VR (the column number i contains the real part, and the
                column number i+1 contains the imaginary part), and the vector
                corresponding to the second eigenvalue is a complex conjugate to
                the first vector.
                Arrays whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].

Result:
    True, if the algorithm has converged.
    False, if the algorithm has not converged.

Note 1:
    Some users may ask the following question: what if WI[N-1]>0?
    WI[N] must contain an eigenvalue which is complex conjugate to the
    N-th eigenvalue, but the array has only size N?
    The answer is as follows: such a situation cannot occur because the
    algorithm finds a pairs of eigenvalues, therefore, if WI[i]>0, I is
    strictly less than N-1.

Note 2:
    The algorithm performance depends on the value of the internal parameter
    NS of the InternalSchurDecomposition subroutine which defines the number
    of shifts in the QR algorithm (similarly to the block width in block-matrix
    algorithms of linear algebra). If you require maximum performance
    on your machine, it is recommended to adjust this parameter manually.

The algorithm is based on the LAPACK 3.0 library.
