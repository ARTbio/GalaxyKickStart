Student's t distribution

Computes the integral from minus infinity to t of the Student
t distribution with integer k > 0 degrees of freedom:

                                     t
                                     -
                                    | |
             -                      |         2   -(k+1)/2
            | ( (k+1)/2 )           |  (     x   )
      ----------------------        |  ( 1 + --- )        dx
                    -               |  (      k  )
      sqrt( k pi ) | ( k/2 )        |
                                  | |
                                   -
                                  -inf.

Relation to incomplete beta integral:

       1 - stdtr(k,t) = 0.5 * incbet( k/2, 1/2, z )
where
       z = k/(k + t**2).

For t < -2, this is the method of computation.  For higher t,
a direct method is derived from integration by parts.
Since the function is symmetric about t=0, the area under the
right tail of the density is found by calling the function
with -t instead of t.

ACCURACY:

Tested at random 1 <= k <= 25.  The "domain" refers to t.
                     Relative error:
arithmetic   domain     # trials      peak         rms
   IEEE     -100,-2      50000       5.9e-15     1.4e-15
   IEEE     -2,100      500000       2.7e-15     4.9e-17
