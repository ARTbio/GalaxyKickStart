Jacobian Elliptic Functions

Evaluates the Jacobian elliptic functions sn(u|m), cn(u|m),
and dn(u|m) of parameter m between 0 and 1, and real
argument u.

These functions are periodic, with quarter-period on the
real axis equal to the complete elliptic integral
ellpk(1.0-m).

Relation to incomplete elliptic integral:
If u = ellik(phi,m), then sn(u|m) = sin(phi),
and cn(u|m) = cos(phi).  Phi is called the amplitude of u.

Computation is by means of the arithmetic-geometric mean
algorithm, except when m is within 1e-9 of 0 or 1.  In the
latter case with m close to 1, the approximation applies
only for phi < pi/2.

ACCURACY:

Tested at random points with u between 0 and 10, m between
0 and 1.

           Absolute error (* = relative error):
arithmetic   function   # trials      peak         rms
   IEEE      phi         10000       9.2e-16*    1.4e-16*
   IEEE      sn          50000       4.1e-15     4.6e-16
   IEEE      cn          40000       3.6e-15     4.4e-16
   IEEE      dn          10000       1.3e-12     1.8e-14

 Peak error observed in consistency check using addition
theorem for sn(u+v) was 4e-16 (absolute).  Also tested by
the above relation to the incomplete elliptic integral.
Accuracy deteriorates when u is large.
