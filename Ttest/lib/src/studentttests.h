One-sample t-test

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given sample.  The
following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is equal  to  the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  mean  is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is less than or  equal
      to the given value).

The test is based on the assumption that  a  given  sample  has  a  normal
distribution and  an  unknown  dispersion.  If  the  distribution  sharply
differs from normal, the test will work incorrectly.

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of sample.
    Mean    -   assumed value of the mean.

Output parameters:
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
