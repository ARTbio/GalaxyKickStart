# Getting Started

# Getting the playbook

[//]: # (TODO: Once we do releases, we include the submodules and hence users can just download the playbook without git)


GalaxyKickstarter is hosted on [github](https://github.com/ARTbio/galaxy-kickstart.git) and makes use of submodules, so care
needs to be taken to also download the submodules. Cloning the repository for the first time can be done like this
(note the `--recursive`):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ARTbio/galaxy-kickstart.git
```

The playbook (here `galaxy.yml`) should be in the galaxy-kickstart folder.
```bash
ls galaxy-kickstart/
CONTRIBUTORS.md  docs  extra-files  galaxy.yml  group_vars  hosts
LICENSE.txt  mkdocs.yml  pre-commit.sh  README.md  roles  Vagrantfile
```


# Deploying galaxy-kickstart on remote machines.
----

Inside the repository you will find a hosts file.
This is an example inventory.

```
[kickstart]
localhost ansible_ssh_user="root" ansible_ssh_private_key_file="~/.ssh/id_rsa"
...
```

Here `[kickstart]` is a group, that contains a machine called localhost.
The variables defined in `group_vars/kickstart` will be applied to this host.
Ansible will connect by ssh to this machine, using the ssh key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

If you would like to run this playbook on a remote machine by ssh (currently needs to be a debian-type machine),
create a new inventory, and change `localhost` to the IP address of that machine.
`ansible_ssh_user=<user>` controls under which username to connect to this machine.
This user needs to have sudo rights.

Then, run the plabook by typing:
```
ansible-playbook --inventory-file=<your_inventory> galaxy.yml
```

You can put multiple machines in your inventory.
If you run the playbook a second time, the process will be much faster, since steps that have already been executed will be skipped.
Whenever you change a variable (see [customizations](customizations.md)), you need to run the playbook again.
