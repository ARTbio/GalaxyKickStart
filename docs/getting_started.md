# Getting Started

## You need [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
## Make sure that you have a recent version of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/) installed
The playbook has been tested with Ansible stable versions 2.1 and 2.2

### Install Ansible with pip

A simple way to install the latest Ansible version is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

##### Install pip

```
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get -y install python-pip python-dev
```

- Ensure you have recent pip version installed (sudo -i && pip install upgrade pip maybe necessary)

pip upgrade:
```
sudo pip install -U pip
```
```
$ pip --version
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
```

- Then

```
pip install ansible==2.2.0.0
```
### Install Ansible with apt

Alternatively, Ansible may be installed with the Apt package manager (Ubuntu):

```
sudo -i
apt-get install software-properties-common
apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
apt-get update
apt-get install ansible
```

# Getting the playbook

[//]: # (TODO: Once we do releases, we include the submodules and hence users can just download the playbook without git)

GalaxyKickStart is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart.git) and uses a number of
dependent Ansible roles that need to be downloaded as part of the installation
step:

```
git clone https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart.git
cd GalaxyKickStart
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements_roles.yml -p roles
```

The playbook (here `galaxy.yml`) should be in the GalaxyKickStart folder.
```bash
ls
CONTRIBUTORS.md		Vagrantfile		docs			inventory_files		roles
Dockerfile		ansible.cfg		extra-files		mkdocs.yml		scripts
LICENSE.txt		deploy.sh		galaxy.yml		pre-commit.sh		startup.sh
README.md		dockerfiles		group_vars		requirements_roles.yml	templates
```

# Deploying galaxy-kickstart on remote machines.
----

Inside the `inventory_files` folder, you will find a number of inventory files.
This is an example of inventory taken from the `artimed` inventory file.

```
[artimed]
localhost ansible_ssh_user="root" ansible_ssh_private_key_file="~/.ssh/id_rsa"
...
```

Here `[artimed]` is a group, that contains a machine called localhost.
The variables defined in `group_vars/artimed` will be applied to this host.
Ansible will connect by ssh to this machine, using the ssh key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

If you would like to run this playbook on a remote machine by ssh (currently needs to be a debian-type machine),
create a new inventory, and change `localhost` to the IP address of that machine.
`ansible_ssh_user=<user>` controls under which username to connect to this machine.
This user needs to have sudo rights.

Then, run the plabook by typing:
```
ansible-playbook --inventory-file inventory_files/<your_inventory_file> galaxy.yml
```

You can put multiple machines in your inventory.
If you run the playbook a second time, the process will be much faster, since steps that have already been executed will be skipped.
Whenever you change a variable (see [customizations](customizations.md)), you need to run the playbook again.

## Deploying galaxy-kickstart on specified clouds

Inside the repository you will find a [file](https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart/tree/master/inventory_files/cloud)
called `inventory_files/cloud`. This file serves as an example hosts file for
how to deploy galaxy-kickstart on Google Compute Engine (GCE),  Amazon Web
Services(aws), and Jetstream (OpenStack). *Please note that the `ansible_user`
variable in the file changes for each remote target*. If you are wanting to use
this playbook on a cloud other than the ones listed  below, you will need to
update the inventory to add a new section header for the respective target. If
this happens to be a cloud setup, make sure to add the section header under
`[cloud_setup:children]`.

Specifications for each remote target:

* OpenStack
    * Image needed to deploy on [Jetstream](http://jetstream-cloud.org/):
        `Ubuntu 14.04.3 Development (jetstream image id: d7fe3289-943f-4417-90e8-8a6b171677ca)`
    *  Inventory: `<remote host IP> anisble_ssh_user="root" ansible_ssh_private_key_file="<path/to/your/private/key>"`

* GCE
    * Image needed to deploy galaxy-kickstart: `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
    * Inventory: ` <remote host IP> anisble_ssh_user="ubuntu" ansible_ssh_private_key_file="<path/to/your/private/key>"`

* AWS
    * Image needed to deploy galaxy-kickstart: `Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-2d39803a`
    * Inventory: `<target Amazon Web Services IP address> ansible_ssh_user="ubuntu" ansible_ssh_private_key_file="<path/to/your/aws/private/key>"`
