# Metavisitor

[Metavisitor] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/048983) is a user-friendly and adaptable software to provide biologists, clinical researchers and possibly diagnostic clinicians with the ability to robustly detect and reconstruct viral genomes from complex deep sequence datasets. A set of modular bioinformatic tools and workflows was implemented as the Metavisitor package in the Galaxy framework. Using the graphical Galaxy workflow editor, users with minimal computational skills can use existing Metavisitor workflows or adapt them to suit specific needs by adding or modifying analysis modules.

Here we provide documentation on how to install and use a Galaxy server instance with pre-installed Metavisitor tools and workflows.

- Using GalaxyKickstarter: see [Metavisitor with GalaxyKickstarter (Ansible)](metavisitor_ansible.md)
- Using Docker: see [Metavitor with Docker](metavisitor_docker.md)


Metavisitor has been developed at the [ARTbio platform](http://artbio.fr) its tools and workflows are available in [GitHub] (https://github.com/ARTbio/tools-artbio) and in the [Galaxy main tool shed] (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).
